//GROUP 1: EXPRESSIONS WITH CONDITIONALS


//Last Chance for Gas
// To calculate the number of miles a a car can drive with a specific amount of fuel, the
//formula to find out the number of miles the fuel can cover is gauge reading of gas in %/100 *tank capacity in gallons*Miles per gallon

var gasEfficiency= prompt("Please enter the gas efficiency of your car in miles per gallon");//value is in miles per gallon

var gaugeReading=prompt("Please enter the gauge reading of the gas tank in percentage");//input in % value

var gasTankCapacity=prompt("Please enter your gas tank capacity in gallons");//value is in gallons

var actualGasInTank= gaugeReading/100* gasTankCapacity;//the amount of gas in tank is gauge reading in%/100*gas tank capacity

var miles= actualGasInTank* gasEfficiency;//the miles the car can cover is amount of gas in the car* the gas efficiency

var statement1="Yes, you can make it without stopping for gas!";

var statement2= "You only have "+ actualGasInTank+ " gallons of gas in your tank, better get gas now while you can!";


if (miles>=200){console.log(statement1);//it is safe to keep driving if the the amount of gas is sufficient for 200 miles or more
}else{console.log(statement2)};
