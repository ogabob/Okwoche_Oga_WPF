//we will be deciding what kind of shape given the length of sides.

alert("We want to know the kind of shape given the length of sides of the shape")//it is easy to know if a specific shape is a square following the conditions below.

var a=prompt("Please enter the length of side a")//length in meters
var b= prompt("Please enter the length of side b")//length in meters
var c= prompt("please enter the length of side c")//length in meters
var d= prompt("please enter the length  of side d")//length in meters

 var area=a*b*c*d// this is the area of the shape

 (area/2===a*b/2)? console.log("This is a square"):console.log("you figure out the shape")// the area of a square is 2 times the area of a triangle.this is a ternary that shows if the condition is either true or false. it looks like ternaries do not work in functions. I will have to ask Ms Carroll about that.
